	<h2>Where did this data come from?</h2>
	<p>The data was collected from my phone's sensors, using the AWARE framework.</p>
	<p>My phone indicated the sensors were syncing often, but when I would check the database, the
	data showing up was inconsistent. If I looked at the last date of something (and converted it from a
	UNIX timestamp into a date) sometimes they seemed to be recent times and sometimes not. I thought that
	they'd all be syncing or not syncing so that maybe that data hadn't shown up yet, but I now realized
	that some sensors were correctly syncing to the database and some were not.</p>
	<p>I also tried downloading my location history from Google Timeline but it is is a very complex, layered
	JSON and is my entire history. I could not figure out an easy way to filter it to limit to recent locations
	only.</p>
	<p>The data was sourced from sensors in my phone, but not all data collected was able to be analyzed.</p>

	<h2>Who has access to it?</h2>
